Lower values means higher clarity of the image after shading rejection of the history, but at the trade of higher instability of the pixel on following frames accumulating new details which can be distracting to the human eye (Defaults to 2.0)."

r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering
"Instability in TSR output 99% of the time coming from instability of the shading rejection, for different reasons:
 - One first source of instability is most famously moire pattern between structured geometry and the rendering pixel grid changing every frame due to the offset of the jittering pixel grid offset;
 - Another source of instability can happen on extrem geometric complexity due to temporal history's chicken-and-egg problem that can not be overcome by other mechanisms in place in TSR's RejectHistory pass: how can the history be identical to rendered frame if the amount of details you have in the rendered frame is not in history? how can the history accumulate details if the history is too different from the rendered frame?

When enabled, this flickering temporal analysis monitor how the luminance of the scene right before any translucency drawing stored in the TSR.Flickering.Luminance resource how it involves over successive frames. And if it is detected to constantly flicker regularily above a certain threshold defined with this r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.* cvars, the heuristic attempts to stabilize the image by letting ghost within luminance boundary tied to the amplititude of flickering.

Use "r.TSR.Visualize 7" command to see on screen where this heuristic quicks in orange and red. Pink is where it is disabled.

One particular caveat of this heuristic is that any opaque geometry with incorrect motion vector can make a pixel look identically flickery quicking this heuristic in and leaving undesired ghosting effects on the said geometry. When that happens, it is highly encourage to verify the motion vector through the VisualizeMotionBlur show flag and how these motion vectors are able to reproject previous frame with the VisualizeReprojection show flag.

The variable to countrol the frame frequency at which a pixel is considered flickery and needs to be stabilized with this heuristic is defined with the r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period in frames. For instance, a value r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period=3, it means any pixel that have its luminance changing of variation every more often than every frames is considered flickering.

However another caveats on this boundary between flickering pixel versus animated pixel is that: flickering happens regardless of frame rate, whereas a visual effects that are/should be based on time and are therefore independent of the frame rate. This mean that a visual effect that looks smooth at 60hz might appear to 'flicker' at lower frame rates, like 24hz for instance.
To make sure a visual effect authored by an artists doesn't start to ghost of frame rate, r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.AdjustToFrameRate is enabled by default such that this frame frequency boundary is automatically when the frame rate drops below a refresh rate below r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.FrameRateCap.

While r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering is controled based of scalability settings turn on/off this heuristic on lower/high-end GPU the other r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.* can be set orthogonally in the Project's DefaultEngine.ini for a consistent behavior across all platforms.

It is enabled by default in the anti-aliasing scalability group High, Epic and Cinematic."

"Framerate cap in hertz at which point there is automatic adjustment of r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period when the rendering frame rate is lower. Please read r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering's help for further details. (Default to 60hz)"

r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.AdjustToFrameRate
"Whether r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period settings should adjust to frame rate when below r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.FrameRateCap. Please read r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering's help for further details. (Enabled by default)."

r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.MaxParallaxVelocity
"Some material might for instance might do something like parallax occlusion mapping such as CitySample's buildings' window's interiors. This often can not render accurately a motion vector of this fake interior geometry and therefore make the heuristic believe it is in fact flickering.

This variable define the parallax velocity in 1080p pixel at frame rate defined by r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.FrameRateCap at which point the heuristic should be disabled to not ghost. 
(Default to 10 pixels 1080p).
"

r.TSR.ShadingRejection.TileOverscan
"The shading rejection run a network of convolutions on the GPU all in single 32x32 without roundtrip to main video memory. However chaining many convlutions in this tiles means that some convolutions on the edge arround are becoming corrupted and therefor need to overlap the tile by couple of padding to hide it. Higher means less prones to tiling artifacts, but performance loss."

r.TSR.ShadingRejection.ExposureOffset
"The shading rejection needs to have a representative idea how bright a linear color pixel ends up displayed to the user. And the shading rejection detect if a color become to changed to be visible in the back buffer by comparing to MeasureBackbufferLDRQuantizationError().

It is important to have TSR's MeasureBackbufferLDRQuantizationError() ends up distributed uniformly across the range of color intensity or it could otherwise disregard some subtle VFX causing ghostin.

This controls adjusts the exposure of the linear color space solely in the TSR's rejection heuristic, such that higher value lifts the shadows's LDR intensity, meaning MeasureBackbufferLDRQuantizationError() is decreased in these shadows and increased in the highlights, control directly.

The best TSR internal buffer to verify this is TSR.Flickering.Luminance, either with the "show VisualizeTemporalUpscaler" command or in DumpGPU with the RGB Linear[0;1] source color space against the Tonemaper's output in sRGB source color space.
"

r.TSR.RejectionAntiAliasingQuality
"Controls the quality of TSR's built-in spatial anti-aliasing technology when the history needs to be rejected. While this may not be critical when the rendering resolution is not much lowered than display resolution, this technic however becomes essential to hide lower rendering resolution rendering because of two reasons:
 - the screen space size of aliasing is inverse proportional to rendering resolution;
 - rendering at lower resolution means need more frame to reach at least 1 rendered pixel per display pixel.

Use "r.TSR.Visualize 6" command to see on screen where the spatial anti-aliaser quicks in green.

By default, it is only disabled by default in the low anti-aliasing scalability group."

Then every frame, TSR will attempt to reproject either previous frame, or the oldest persistent frame available based which matches best the current frames. The later option will happen when something previously seen by TSR shows up again (no matter through parallax disocclusion, shading changes, translucent VFX moving) which will have the advantage bypass the need to newly accumulate a second time by simply resurrected the previously accumulated details.

Please note this clamp the sample count in history pixel, not output pixel, and therefore lower values are by designed less noticeable with higher r.TSR.History.ScreenPercentage. This is done so such that increasing r.TSR.History.ScreenPercentage uniterally & automatically give more temporal stability and maintaining sharpness of the details reprojection at the expense of that extra runtime cost regardless of this setting.
